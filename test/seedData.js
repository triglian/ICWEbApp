The Liceo Classico is school with an emphasy on humanities, so he is not used to scientific subjects but he is really motivated in reaching my aims and do all my best. He has been interested in Informatics since 2004, when my parents first bought me a Personal Computer. He used to spent my days trying to figure out how this incredible machine worked and maybe, some day, be able to create programs all by myself. In his family he is regarded as the one who can do everything with a keyboard and a mouse. He think that they exagerate with their considerations, but he wish that other people, one day, would say the same about him. Finally, after more or less 10 years, he had the possibility to discover this world deeper than before; He tried to do my best to have good results and work in this field that has always interested him.",

Be it as a tool of research or as a science in its own right I think informatics has the wonderful capacity of changing not only the world, but also the way we see it.
